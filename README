			Linux	Cryptographic	Library

motivation
	I needed a library of functions that enabled me to perform hash 
functions and symmetric cryptography. I chose MD5 initially but 
eventually chose SHA as the hashing algorithm due to concerns regarding 
the 'collision resistance' of MD5 due to weakness in the compression 
function.
	I chose Blowfish over DES or triple DES due to the fact that DES 
has a restricted key length nad had been successfully attacked whereas 
Blowfish has variable key lengths and also, known attacks rely on fewer rounds 
being used, and as the full complement of rounds would be used, I did not see 
this as an issue. The library allows blowfish to be used with any key size 
from 64 bit (although 128 bit and greater (up to 448 bit) is recommended.
	Finally, I chose the bnlib-1.1 multi precision library by Colin 
Plum so that I could implement RSA easily. RSA is used for public key 
cryptography and for signing keys and data.

The implementor of the blowfish code I use is Paul Kocher (pck@netcom.com)
The implementor of the SHA code I use is Uwe Hollerbach (uh@alumni.caltech)
	The code for SHA is derived from Peter C. Gutmann's implementation 
	as found in Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
The implementor of the multi precision library bnlib-1.1 is Colin Plumb

The implementor of the RSA code used is John Horton (jh_squirrel@yahoo.com)
